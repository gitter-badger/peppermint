Peppermint Bug/Features tracker
==========

OK, so welcome to the official bug/features tracker for Peppermint.

We're open to suggestions / ideas / bug reports / feature requests. Anything goes!
And we needed an easy way to keep it all organized, in one place, and help you help us make Peppermint the most awesome editor for OSX.

So, here you are: just jump to the Issues page, and shoot us! ;-)

Welcome on board!
